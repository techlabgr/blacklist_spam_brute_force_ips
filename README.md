# Networks reported as spam and brute force attacks
This is a collection of networks reported as spam and brute force attacks. They most used for brute force attacks to other networks, mostly website (Wordpress, Joomla, Sip Servers like 3CX and many others.) This collection of networks is mostly IPS clients networks that they DON'T host any kind of service neither they used for Backbone Exchange....... so it's safe to blacklist them PERMANETLY. 
In my case i have an eshop site and B2B and have start to see failed login attempts from various ips. I start to block them from the .htaccess file but they attacks keep comming and icreasing day by day. I notice they all come from the same networks so instead to block an IP, i block all the network of that IP. In 6 days the attacks from 765 per day they have fall to 56 per day.

The collection of that networks they update and grow every week but the blacklisted networks DON'T CHANGE they are they same, i just ADD new ones everytime i discover them. Also this collections is cross check it with several BlackListed Databases to be sure that is 100% a BlackListed IP, checked with cleantalk.org, dshield.org, stopforumspam.com and many others.
The list is from networks of Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Vietnam, Thailand, India, Pakistan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and a couple from France, Italy, Germany, England, Netherlands and America
